        <h2>How food is power for brain and fuel for coding?</h2>
<p>Coding teaches us how to creatively approach solving repetitive problems and testing out our own ideas. </p>

<p>It can be an incredibly fun, incredibly frustrating and above all, an incredibly rewarding career or a hobby. </p>

<p>Every developer from time to time reaches a point where they are being stuck or doubt their own abilities- doesn&#8217t matter how many times you run through your code, and it still seems that finding the reason why it is not working seems virtually impossible. Coding requires your brain to work on a full speed, your constant focus and loads of patience, especially if you have only gotten your teeth into it. Nourishing your brain with the right food is essential if you see yourself becoming a developer.</p>

<p>Food for coding is created for girls who like food and who have just started to code, because just like you- we love food and we are new to coding! </p>

<p>Below you&#8217ll find some delicious recipes to keep your brain running all day and tips on how to make the next step into the programming world. </p>
